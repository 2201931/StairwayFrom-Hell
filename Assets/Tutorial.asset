  - You dare to climb the steps of the stairway from hell! its the only exit out
    of hell, given to those who survive the treacherous climb..
  - And no one survives.
  - I mean look at me im missing half my skin HAHAHAHAHAHA

  - Get through the novice fire pit climb as your first challenge. Then its a straight
    up climb from there!
  - 'Take this from an experienced climber... you''re going to want to use RMB to
    jump, you''ll be able to charge these jumps, and a directional arrow will show
    you where you''re aiming your jump '
  - Good Luck!
