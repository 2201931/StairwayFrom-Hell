  sentences:
  - Welcome to hell guy!
  - You're going to bere a looooong time
  - Better get comfortable..
  - ...
  - Unless..
  - You dare climb the Stairway from Hell, a treacherous climb to the only exit back
    to the physical world, only the brave survive..
  - And no one survives
  - I mean look at me, I lost half my skin! HAHAHAHAHAHA
  - HA
  - Complete the Novice Firepit Climb to prove your worth! Then its a straight up
    climb from there!
  - Also take this from an experienced climber.. if you use your RMB youll be able
    to jump, and a directional arrow will show you where to go.
  - Good Luck!
